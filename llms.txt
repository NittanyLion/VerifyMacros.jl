# VerifyMacros.jl

> A Julia package for runtime verification with descriptive, styled error messages.

Runtime verification often involves repetitive boilerplate and generic error messages. VerifyMacros.jl provides a suite of macros to assert conditions (types, keys, files, etc.) and produces auto-generated, color-coded, and descriptive errors when those assertions fail.
